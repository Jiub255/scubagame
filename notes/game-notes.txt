Now it's a diving game.


TODO:
-------------

Have harpoon gun follow mouse, independent of travel direction.
	Then add controller support, crosscode style. Left stick movement, right stick aim.

Fix fish moving when shot.

Have "doors" into other maps, to represent a third dimension kind of. 2.5d-ish. Good for variety in caves/tunnels.
<<<<<<< HEAD
	Or maybe not, but do have cave entrances you can go into.
	Have enemies follow you in/out of caves if they are targeting you.

Make variety of spaces:
	tight tunnels
	wide open depths
	super deep pits
	long shallow waters (with land spots you have to jump over while being chased by enemies)

Make a new parallax background, but have the closest layer be the water layer, so it doesn't move.
	Try to work above horizon parallax in.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Make another state machine for Player. Can't mix states like take damage and air. They're separate concepts.
Maybe have a air/water state machine that controls physics like gravity.
Then have another for combat, like take damage and die.

Eventually try out behavior trees with enemies, for practice at least.

Make own art.
	Try procedural generation for background. Simple, like spawning random ocean features as it scrolls.
	Add swimming fish and stuff to the parallax layers.
	Maybe try a different theme/idea. Doesn't have to be a diver. Maybe a fish or something. Or a submarine.
		I like the water mechanics though so keep that.

Have giant whales that can swallow you.
	Inside of them is like a mini-dungeon, with some reward at the end.


DONE:
-------------

Fix fish swimming in air and through land.

Add breath system.
	Put Air level on UI.
